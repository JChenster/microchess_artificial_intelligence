# MicroChess Artificial Intelligence
I'm using genetic programming to develop a simple heuristic to be used in greedy play for Micro Chess, a 4x5 version of Chess that simplifies the complexity of chess while preserving many of the rules.
 
To run my demonstration:
```
git clone https://github.com/JChenster/microchess_artificial_intelligence
make
```
